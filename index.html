				<h4>Global Warming</h4>
				<p>Global warming is one of the biggest challenges facing the world today. In simple terms, it means that the Earth is getting hotter over time. Scientists have noticed that the average temperature of the planet has been rising for more than a century, and most of this change is linked to human activities. While the Earth’s climate has always changed naturally, the speed and scale of the warming we are seeing today is much greater than anything in the past.
					</p>
				<p>The main reason for global warming is the greenhouse effect. Normally, the Earth’s atmosphere traps some heat from the sun to keep the planet warm enough for life. This is a natural process, and without it, Earth would be too cold to live on. However, human activities like burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests have added a lot more greenhouse gases to the air, especially carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap extra heat, making the planet warmer than it should be.</p>

				<p>The effects of global warming are already visible. One of the most serious consequences is the melting of ice in polar regions and mountain glaciers. This causes sea levels to rise, which threatens coastal areas and small islands. Millions of people living near the sea may lose their homes if this continues.

				<p>The main cause of global warming is the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and make the Earth warmer than it should be. The biggest contributor is burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. People burn these fuels to drive cars, run factories, and produce electricity, and all of this releases large amounts of carbon dioxide. The following cause the build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Burning fossil fuels</li>
					<li>Deforestation</li>
					<li>Agriculture</li>
					<li>Industrial Activities and waste</li>

				<h3>Causes</h3>
				<p>The main factors that lead to climate change have already been listed, but now we're going to look into them with further detail. As we already established earlier, Global Warming mainly happens because greenhouse gases are increasing in the atmosphere. These gases hold in heat and stop it from escaping, which makes the Earth hotter. The biggest source of this problem is burning fuels like coal, oil, and gas for things such as transport, factories, and electricity. This process releases a lot of carbon dioxide into the air.</p>
				<p>Another cause is cutting down forests. Trees usually take in carbon dioxide, but when they are destroyed for farming or building, two things happen: fewer trees remain to clean the air, and the carbon stored inside the trees is released.</p>
				<p>Farming also adds to the problem. Cows and other livestock produce methane, a gas that warms the planet even more strongly than carbon dioxide. Fertilizers used on crops release nitrous oxide, another harmful gas. On top of that, industries, waste systems, and some everyday products also give off gases that add to global warming.</p>

				<h3>Consequences</h3>
				<p>The impacts of global warming are becoming clearer each year. Rising temperatures are changing natural systems and creating serious challenges for both people and the environment. From melting ice caps to unpredictable weather, the Earth is already showing signs of stress, and these effects are expected to intensify if warming continues.</p>
				<p>Another impact is changes in weather patterns. Some areas are hit by heavier storms, floods, and hurricanes, while others face long heat waves and droughts. These shifts make it harder to grow food, damage crops, and affect farmers’ livelihoods.</p>
				<p>Global warming also harms animals and ecosystems. Species like polar bears and penguins are struggling as ice disappears, while coral reefs are dying because the oceans are warming. Since many fish rely on reefs, entire food chains are being affected.</p>
				<p>Humans are affected too. Higher temperatures bring health dangers such as heat stress and the wider spread of diseases. On top of that, global warming creates financial challenges for governments and communities, since they must spend more money on healthcare, rebuilding after disasters, and adapting to the changes.</p>

                           <h3>Raising Awareness</h3>
                           <p>One important way to fight climate change is by raising awareness, just like we're doing now! When people understand how their actions, like wasting energy or cutting down trees, affect the planet, they are more likely to change their behavior. Awareness campaigns in schools, communities, and through media can teach people about recycling, saving energy, and protecting forests. By spreading knowledge, individuals and communities can take small steps that add up to a big impact, such as using less plastic, supporting clean energy, or voting for leaders who prioritize the environment.</p>

                           <h3>Try Solar Power!</h3>
                           <p>Another effective solution is the use of solar power. Unlike coal, oil, or gas, solar energy does not release harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Solar panels capture energy from the sun, which can then be used to produce electricity for homes, businesses, and even schools. As technology improves and solar panels become more affordable, more people and countries can switch to solar energy, helping to slow down global warming. You don't even need to fully implement it at the start if that's too much for you. You can simply begin with just a solar powered phone charger, or a few solar powered lights around your home.</p>

                           <h3>Use Electric Devices</h3>
                           <p>Switching to electric alternatives is another solution to reduce global warming. Many machines and vehicles we use every day still run on fossil fuels, such as petrol cars, gas stoves, and diesel generators. These release a lot of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. By replacing them with electric cars, induction cookers, and solar-powered or battery-based devices, we can cut down on pollution and reduce the demand for fossil fuels. If the electricity that powers these devices comes from clean sources like wind or solar, the environmental benefits are even greater. Using electric alternatives can  help lower the impact of climate change.</p>
